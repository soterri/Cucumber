Cucumber is a tool that supports BDD (Behavior Driven Development) which is 
used to write acceptance tests for web applications

BDD is an agile software development process that encourages collabs
among developers, QA team, non techs, and business participants
in a software project.

Gherkin language is used in BDD and we will be using it in the form
of English

Gherkin has syntax/keywords

Given -> precondition
When -> action
Then -> result/outcome
And -> continuing with steps (given, when, then)

US 54545 - As an admin I should be able to login into HRMS

Given - I/User opened browser
And - User navigated to HRMS application
When - User enters valid username and password
And - User clicks on login button
Then - User is logged in successfully
And - User sees welcome message is displayed

Who uses Gherkin?
BA
QA - writing acceptance test, cucumber tests

Example:
User Story 51454: Admin should be able to search for an employee
	Feature: Employee Search
	
	Acceptance Criteria:
	1. User can search by ID
	2. User can search by name
----------------------------
Gherkin Examples:
	Acceptance Criteria written by BA
	
	1. Search by ID
	Given - user opens browser and user navigates to HRMS
	And - user is logged in as an admin
	And - user navigates to the employee list page
	When - user enters valid employee id
	And - user clicks on search button
	Then - user sees employee in the employee table
	
2. Search by name
Given - user opens browse and user navigates to HRMS
	And - user is logged in as an admin
	And - user navigates to the employee list page
	When - user enters valid employees first and last name
	And - user clicks on search button
	Then user sees employee in the employee table

Cucumber, Specflow

Cucumber Test: written by QA

Feature: search for an employee
Scenario: search employee by id

IN CUCUMBER, WE HAVE 2 IMPORTANT FILES:

FEATURE FILE -> write our test case using gherkin keywords

STEP DEFINITION -> providing implementation code using java for
every gherkin step.
1 gherkin step should have only 1 implementation step
doesn't matter which feature file but has to have 1 gherkin step 1 java step


TestRunner class will be executing our cucumber features using junit
based on configs it can execute one or multiple feature files
to execute feature files, we will be using jUnit. so when we add in in pom
using java, to run cucumber tests, use cucumber junit..

to implement we need to create a separate test runner class insuede test runner class we need to specify which cucumber features we will be running
on top of the class we will have to specify keywords, we will specifiy annoation @RunWith  a junit annoation we will specify running cucumber class

Test Runner - will help us execute all cucumber tests using jUnit
we will have to specify configurations using CucumberOptions:

features: = "src\test\resources\features" which will specify which feature file to run
OR if you want specific src\test\resouces\login.feature

glue = com\hrms\steps - we we can find implementation code for gherkin steps

dryRun - if its set to true, then it will scan to find whether we missed any steps/implementation or not

HOOKS - a block of code that gets executed before and after each scenario
@Before
@After
When preconditions and post condition are same for all scenarios


Execution process
1. Before Hook
2. Background
3. All scenario steps
4. After hook
same process for every scenario

Hooks VS Background
hooks applicable for all scenarios within the project
while background for all scenarios within particular feature file 
that has the same gherkin steps

Scenario consists of steps that will be executed only once whille
using scenario outline we will execue same steps/scenarios # of times
depending on how much data we will specify in Examples

Example of a US for Cucumber
US 55454: As an admin, user should see 8 dashboard menus displayed
Admin
Pim
Leave
Time
Recruitment
Performance
Dashboard
Directory

Implementing Cucumber Maven Reports:

1. Specify json plugin in our test runner - it will generste .json file
