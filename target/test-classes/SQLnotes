Loops in Java:
while
do while
for
enhanced for loop/for each loop/advanced for loop

FOR LOOP:
when to use? when we know a number of repetition/iterations in advance

SYNTAX: for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement){
code to repeat;
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHILE LOOP AND DO WHILE: if we don't know the number of repetitions

WHILE vs. DO WHILE:

WHILE checks condition first -> then executes codes

DO WHILE: executes than checks the condition

SYNTAX: 
while(boolean condition){
code to repeat;
}

do {
}
while(boolean condition){
}


NESTED LOOPS: loops inside another loop

syntax:
for(int i=1; i>5; i++){
Sysout("Hello");

	for(int j=q; j<=3; i++){
	sysout-"bye";
}

GIT Class 1

What is a version control system?


What version control are you currently using?
GITHUB. 

What's a command?
An instruction for the terminal to be executed.

SIGNS:
The tilda ~ 
the / indicates a directory ex: /users/terri 
. represents an ext to a particular file or represent a hidden directory bc they don't want you to access it.
test.txt - this dot represents a directory

cd (Change directory) command is one of the most important and widely sued command.

What is a directory?
Fancy word for folder. 

Home Directory: 
the directory in which you find yourself when you first login

PWD:
print working directory

List all contents in the present working directory: LS
you can see all the current in the present withing a directing anytime using the LS command
having the ability to navigate to a folder

List of Hidden Files: ls -la
List of all files including hidden files starting with '.'
You can see all the files including hidden files present within a working directory anytime using
the command ls -la

Why use GIT STATUS?
to tell the difference b/w tracked and untracked files
indicates to us where we are in the flow
what we staged

GIT INIT: initializes repository, creates local repository

.git is local repository

does the local repository live in working directory. yes.
not the same thing tho. 


Steps to Push JavaClasses to remote repository!
1. cd ~
2. pwd to check you're in the right directory
3. ls to check directories
4. MOVE INTO eclipse-workspace/ by commanding CD eclipse-workspace/
4. ls to check what's inside the eclipse-workspace
5. MOVE INTO javabasics -- cd JavaBasics
6. ls you will see bin src
7. GIT INIT!!!! initialize your repository!!
8. git status
9. git add .
10. git commit -m"message goes here"
11. make the connection b/w your local repository to your remote repository
ex:  git remote add origin https://github.com/soterrii/JavaClassesFrom0to19.git
12. push code! git push -u origin master
13. git log


Stashing:






SQL:

What is a QUERY?
a request to a specific set of data to get information

What is SELECT?
used to list the contents of a table from a database

WHERE clause?
used to set a condition to get a specific data from a table

* -> means all info

DISTINCT keyword:
used to eliminate the duplicates from the specific column

Functions in SQL
Single row --> upper(), lower(), initcap()

select upper(first_name) -> will convert to upper case automatically
from hr.employees;

select first_name
from hr.employees
where upper(first name) = 'Terri'; -> need to specify a condition ourselves


select * from hr.employees

select UPPER(first_name);
from hr.employees;

select first_name
from hr.employees

SubQueries
Subquery is a query within a query
has two parts - 1. outer query 2. inner query

Result of inner query will be used as an input from the outer query

select * from ohrm_job_title

multiple row functions - alot of entries and single results

--display all info about employees who are developers
select id from ohrm_job_title 
where job_id = 'Developer'; ->  returns id from job title table

select * from hs_hr_employees
where job_title_code = (select id from ohrm_job_title where job_title = 'Developer');

--display the first name, last name of the employees who are Cambodian

select * from ohrm_nationality;
select id from ohrm_nationality;
where name = 'Cambodian' -> returns id for Turkish nationality which is 182

select emp_firstname, emp_lastname
